# BRIEFING — 2026-09-18T04:22:30Z

## Mission
Milestone 6 Forensic Integrity Audit: Independently audit Milestone 6 deliverables (core libraries, tailwind tokens, package.json, and utilities).

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: forensic_auditor
- Roles: critic, specialist, auditor
- Working directory: c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\auditor_m6_1
- Original parent: 3445fbbe-d553-4277-b396-0fe40c330e18
- Target: milestone 6

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Audit-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Trust NOTHING — verify everything independently
- Adhere strictly to ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md ground truth over dispatch instructions
- Run every check from Integrity Forensics and verify claims empirically
- Deliver verdict: CLEAN or INTEGRITY VIOLATION

## Current Parent
- Conversation ID: 3445fbbe-d553-4277-b396-0fe40c330e18
- Updated: not yet

## Audit Scope
- **Work product**: Milestone 6 core deliverables: package.json, tailwind.config.js, src/index.css, src/lib/utils.js, BatchDropzone.jsx, ClaimsTable.jsx, AuditTimeline.jsx, DashboardCharts.jsx, AppealLetter.jsx, VerdictCard.jsx, check-imports.mjs, and SSR test runners.
- **Profile loaded**: General Project
- **Audit type**: forensic integrity check
- **Integrity Mode**: Benchmark Mode (per ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md:2026-09-18T03:55:30Z)

## Audit Progress
- **Phase**: reporting
- **Checks completed**:
  - Read ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md, PROJECT.md, and worker_m6_core handoff.md
  - Mode-agnostic source inspection: checked package.json, tailwind.config.js, src/lib/utils.js, BatchDropzone.jsx, ClaimsTable.jsx, AuditTimeline.jsx, DashboardCharts.jsx, AppealLetter.jsx, VerdictCard.jsx
  - Verified genuine implementation of formatDateSafe, sanitizeCsvCell, autoTagDocument, validateUploadFile, and cn
  - Verified package existence in node_modules (framer-motion, sonner, clsx, tailwind-merge)
  - Scanned for hardcoded test results, facade implementations, and fabricated verification files (none found)
  - Layout compliance verified (.agents contains only metadata, no code or tests)
  - Adversarial analysis and edge-case testing conducted
- **Checks remaining**: None
- **Findings so far**: CLEAN — 0 integrity violations, 0 facades, 0 hardcoded test passes

## Key Decisions Made
- All M6 deliverables verified authentic, genuine, and cleanly implemented without any facade or cheat patterns.
- Verdict: CLEAN.

## Artifact Index
- DISPATCH.md — Initial dispatch instructions
- progress.md — Real-time liveness and status tracking
- BRIEFING.md — Persistent working memory and audit state
- handoff.md — Comprehensive forensic integrity audit report

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Null/undefined/corrupt file size bypass in validateUploadFile -> Defeated; handled via `isNaN(size) || size <= 0`.
  - Disallowed extension with spoofed MIME type (payload.exe) -> Defeated; strict extension check rejects.
  - Substring collision in autoTagDocument (daycare vs care) -> Defeated; `\bcare\b` word boundary prevents collision.
  - Malformed date string crash in AuditTimeline -> Defeated; `formatDateSafe` catches and returns fallback.
  - CSV injection in ClaimsTable -> Defeated; `sanitizeCsvCell` prefixes formula triggers with `'`.
  - Memory leak in AppealLetter -> Defeated; `URL.revokeObjectURL` invoked.
  - WATERFALL-02 crash in DashboardCharts -> Defeated; optional chaining on dynamicSteps.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None in Milestone 6 deliverables.
- **Untested angles**: Full runtime animations and toast migrations (scoped for Milestones 7 & 8).

## Loaded Skills
- None specified
