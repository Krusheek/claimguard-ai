# Project: ClaimGuard AI Frontend Overhaul

## Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 3.4, React Router v6, TanStack Query v5, Axios, Lucide React, Hot Toast.
- **Design System**: Enterprise Healthcare standards — high information density, clinical slate-900/navy hierarchy, medical teal/cyan accents, and standardized status semantics (Emerald/Pass, Amber/Discrepancy, Rose/Violation-Fraud, Blue/Analysis).
- **Visualization Layer**: Interactive SVG/CSS & charting components for financial waterfalls, donut status distributions, rule violation metrics, ELA tamper gauges, and CGHS benchmark bars.
- **Module Boundaries & Code Layout**:
  - `src/types/index.ts`: Unified TypeScript definitions covering all backend schemas (Claim, HospitalBill, InsurancePolicy, RejectionLetter, RuleVerdict, ForensicsResult, AuditTrail).
  - `src/services/api.js`: Resilient API client with data normalization, fallback resilience, and support for all backend endpoints.
  - `src/components/common/`: Shared UI primitives — Skeletons, StatusBadge, Topbar, MetricCard, ErrorBoundary, Tooltips, EmptyStates.
  - `src/components/dashboard/`: Dashboard visual widgets — DashboardCharts (Donut, Waterfall, Bar), ClaimsTable (search, filter tabs, multi-doc pills, sorting, pagination).
  - `src/components/upload/`: UploadStudio (dual-mode: batch multi-drop & guided stepper, document cards with metadata inspection, pre-analysis check).
  - `src/components/analysis/`: Analysis & Forensics Hub — Executive Financial Delta, VerdictCard (rule verdicts with slider/delta bar & IRDAI citations), ForensicsLab (ELA tamper meter, heatmap viewer, CGHS benchmark comparator, clinical consistency matrix), AuditTrailTimeline (SHA-256 block ledger), AppealLetterViewer (letterhead formatting, clipboard copy, print).
  - `src/pages/`: Dashboard.jsx, Upload.jsx, Analysis.jsx.
  - `src/App.jsx`: Enterprise layout shell with desktop Topbar (breadcrumbs, global claim search, tenant selector, auditor profile) and enhanced sidebar.

## Interface Contracts
### Foundations (M1), Dashboard (M2), Upload (M3) -> Analysis Hub (M4)
- Design Tokens: `tailwind.config.js` provides `theme.extend.colors` (`brand`, `medical`, `status`), fonts, and shadow classes.
- API Client: `src/services/api.js` exports normalized functions `getStats()`, `getClaims()`, `getAnalysisResult(id)`, `getReport(id)`, `getAppealDraft(id)`, `getAuditTrail(id)`, `uploadDocument(...)`.
- Types: `src/types/index.ts` provides all data contracts.
- Layout: `src/App.jsx` wraps views with responsive shell, topbar, and sidebar.
- Navigation: `Upload.jsx` navigates to `/analysis/:newClaimId`; `ClaimsTable.jsx` rows navigate to `/analysis/:id`.
