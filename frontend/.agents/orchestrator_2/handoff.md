## 1. Milestone State

| Milestone | Status | Key Deliverables & Evidence |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| **M1: Foundations, Tokens & Shell** | **COMPLETED** | Tailwind theme, TypeScript contracts, API normalizer, shared primitives (Skeletons, StatusBadge, Topbar, MetricCard), App shell with responsive navigation. 61/61 tests pass. |
| **M2: Enterprise Dashboard & Visualizations** | **COMPLETED** | Features 6, 7, 8: Executive KPI cards with sparklines, `DashboardCharts.jsx` (interactive SVG status donut, financial recovery waterfall, rule violation bar chart), `ClaimsTable.jsx` (multi-field search, status filter tabs, sortable columns, tripartite document pills, INR formatting, pagination, CSV export), `Dashboard.jsx` overhauled. 72/72 master tests, 41/41 SSR stress tests, 32/32 table stress tests pass 100%. |
| **M3: Upload Studio & UX Polish** | **COMPLETED** | Features 9, 10, 11: `BatchDropzone.jsx` (dual-mode: batch multi-drop with regex auto-tagging + guided 3-step slots; 25MB & MIME validation), `DocumentCard.jsx` (file metadata, format chips, retag/replace/remove actions), `ReadinessCheck.jsx` (pre-analysis checklist, 4-stage extraction animation, 1-click Apollo Hospital sample claim loader), `Upload.jsx` overhauled. 48-scenario stress harness passes, 0 build errors. |
| **M4: Analysis & Forensics Hub** | **ACTIVE** | Next for Orchestrator 3. Scope: Features 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 in `src/components/analysis/` and `src/pages/Analysis.jsx`. |
| **M5: E2E Verification & Victory Hardening** | **PLANNED** | Full test suite execution, acceptance criteria validation, victory claim to Sentinel. |

## 2. Active Subagents

- None. All 17 subagents spawned by `orchestrator_2` have completed their tasks and delivered verified handoff reports.

---

## 3. Pending Decisions & Architecture Context

- Zero blocking architectural decisions.
- All code layout boundaries are established in `PROJECT.md § Code Layout`:
  ```
  src/components/analysis/
  ├── FinancialDelta.jsx   # Feature 12: High-impact financial comparison waterfall & proportion bar
  ├── VerdictCard.jsx      # Feature 13: Rule verdicts with slider/delta bar & IRDAI citations
  ├── ForensicsLab.jsx     # Feature 14: ELA tamper score meter (0-100 gauge), heatmap viewer, CGHS benchmark
  ├── AuditTimeline.jsx    # Feature 15: Cryptographic SHA-256 block ledger timeline
  └── AppealLetter.jsx     # Feature 16: Formal legal appeal generator with letterhead, copy, print/PDF
  src/pages/
  └── Analysis.jsx         # 4-tab clinical workspace integrating all analysis components
  ```
- All dependencies, Tailwind tokens, and API normalizers are fully implemented and verified.
- The 1-click Apollo Hospital demo claim (`CLM-84920`) is available in `src/services/mockData.js` and already integrated with `Upload.jsx` and `Dashboard.jsx`.

## 4. Remaining Work (Concrete Next Steps for Successor)

1. **Initialize Orchestrator 3**:
   - Working directory: `c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\orchestrator_3`.
   - Read `PROJECT.md`, `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `GATE_STATUS.md`, and this `handoff.md`.
   - Start heartbeat cron.
2. **Execute Milestone 4 (Analysis & Forensics Hub)**:
   - Dispatch Explorers (e.g. `explorer_m4_financial`, `explorer_m4_forensics`, `explorer_m4_appeal`) to blueprint Features 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
   - Dispatch Worker to implement `src/components/analysis/` components and overhaul `src/pages/Analysis.jsx`.
   - Dispatch Gate verification panel (Reviewers, Challengers, Forensic Auditor).
   - Verify all tests and build pass 100%.
3. **Execute Milestone 5 (E2E Verification & Hardening)**:
   - Run complete test suite across all 5 tiers.
   - Run adversarial coverage hardening.
   - Verify production build.
4. **Deliver Victory Claim to Sentinel**:
   - Notify Sentinel (`b8eda2fe-c81a-4824-a0d1-47f2b1b97ef1`) with comprehensive victory claim and handoff report.
