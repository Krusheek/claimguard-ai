## Mission
Implement Milestone 3: Upload Studio & UX Polish (Features 9, 10, 11) in ClaimGuard AI Frontend with genuine logic, dual-mode dropzone, document cards, readiness check, sample loader, extraction animations, and seamless navigation to analysis.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: teamwork_preview_worker
- Roles: implementer, qa, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\worker_m3_upload
- Original parent: bc58ea62-e6ba-49c9-a011-2939171e657b
- Milestone: Milestone 3 (Upload Studio & UX Polish)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Mandatory integrity: NO hardcoding, NO dummy/facade implementations, genuine state management and validation.
- Exclusively own and modify:
  * `src/components/upload/BatchDropzone.jsx` (New)
  * `src/components/upload/DocumentCard.jsx` (New)
  * `src/components/upload/ReadinessCheck.jsx` (New)
  * `src/pages/Upload.jsx` (Overhaul)
- Preserve existing test suites: `npm test`, `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`, `node tests/challenger-m2-table-stress.mjs`, `npm run build`.
- Max file size 25MB (26,214,400 bytes), MIME whitelist (PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF), 0-byte check.
- Dual mode: Batch Multi-Drop (with smart heuristics & fallback) and Guided 3-Step.
- DocumentCard with format chip, formatted size, extraction status, Replace, Remove, Retag.
- ReadinessCheck with visual indicators, dynamic readiness meter, Apollo Benchmark 1-click sample loader (CLM-84920), 4-stage extraction progress animation, and analysis trigger.

## Task Summary
- **What to build**: Dual-mode upload studio, document metadata & inspection cards, pre-analysis readiness check, sample Apollo loader, extraction progress animator, and integrated Upload page.
- **Success criteria**: 100% tests passing, clean build, robust error handling and genuine logic.
- **Interface contracts**: `PROJECT.md`, `explorer_m3_upload/handoff.md`, `explorer_m3_ux/handoff.md`

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented `BatchDropzone.jsx` featuring both Mode A (Batch Multi-Drop with regex auto-tagging heuristics and fallback filling) and Mode B (Guided 3-Step with distinct slotted targets).
- Enforced strict 25MB file size limit (`26,214,400` bytes), MIME whitelist, and 0-byte check via `validateUploadFile` with informative `react-hot-toast` error notifications.
- Created `DocumentCard.jsx` with slot title, original filename, format chips (PDF/PNG/JPG/TIFF), human-readable formatted file size (`formatFileSize`), extraction status badges, and action buttons (Replace via file picker, Remove, and Retag slot dropdown).
- Created `ReadinessCheck.jsx` with 0-100% readiness meter, tripartite verification indicators, forensic checklist, 1-click Apollo Hospital Benchmark Claim Loader (`CLM-84920`), 4-stage sequential extraction progress animation, and gated analysis CTA.
- Overhauled `src/pages/Upload.jsx` into a high-density clinical workspace linking all upload state, dropzones, cards, readiness check, and transition to `/analysis/:claimId`.

## Artifact Index
- `src/components/upload/BatchDropzone.jsx` — Dual-mode dropzone with strict validation & regex auto-tagging
- `src/components/upload/DocumentCard.jsx` — Inspection cards with format chips, size, replace/remove/retag
- `src/components/upload/ReadinessCheck.jsx` — Health check panel, Apollo benchmark loader, 4-stage extraction animator
