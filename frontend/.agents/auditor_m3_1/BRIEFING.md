# BRIEFING — 2026-09-17T19:07:00Z

## Mission
Perform forensic integrity audit of Milestone 3 deliverables (ClaimGuard AI Upload Experience) to ensure genuine logic, schema compliance, clean build, and no violations of R1, R2, R3.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: forensic_auditor
- Roles: [critic, specialist, auditor]
- Working directory: c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\auditor_m3_1
- Original parent: bc58ea62-e6ba-49c9-a011-2939171e657b
- Target: Milestone 3 deliverables (ClaimGuard AI Upload Experience)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Audit-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Trust NOTHING — verify everything independently
- Adhere to ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md constraints as primary authority

## Audit Scope
- **Work product**: Milestone 3 Upload deliverables (`Upload.jsx`, `BatchDropzone.jsx`, `DocumentCard.jsx`, `ReadinessCheck.jsx`, `src/services/api.js`, `src/services/mockData.js`)
- **Profile loaded**: General Project
- **Audit type**: forensic integrity check

## Audit Progress
- **Phase**: reporting
- **Checks completed**:
  1. Check for dummy facades, test bypasses, or fake stubs in file validation, dropzone modes, and readiness calculations. [PASS]
  2. Verify that `validateUploadFile` and `autoTagDocument` implement genuine algorithmic logic. [PASS]
  3. Verify that the sample Apollo loader populates authentic structured document objects conforming to schemas. [PASS]
  4. Verify that `npm run build` succeeds cleanly without compiler warnings or code suppressions. [PASS]
  5. Check for any violation of user requirements R1, R2, R3. [PASS]
- **Findings so far**: CLEAN — No integrity violations or facades detected.

## Key Decisions Made
- All 5 forensic checks verified with empirical evidence. Production build compiles cleanly with zero warnings. Automated test runner confirms 72/72 tests pass across Tiers 1-4. SSR stress tests confirm 41/41 pass. Preparing final audit report with verdict: CLEAN.

## Artifact Index
- DISPATCH.md — Dispatch prompt record
- BRIEFING.md — Persistent working memory
- progress.md — Liveness heartbeat
- handoff.md — Comprehensive forensic audit report

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. Facade/stub detection in `validateUploadFile`: Verified genuine size, boundary, and MIME/ext parsing.
  2. Test bypasses in `autoTagDocument`: Verified genuine regex heuristic rules without hardcoded test cases.
  3. Schema drift in `SAMPLE_APOLLO_CLAIM`: Verified exact conformity with `HospitalBill`, `InsurancePolicy`, and `RejectionLetter` schemas.
  4. Build pipeline integrity: Verified clean Vite build (1710 modules transformed, 0 warnings/errors).
  5. Code suppressions: Verified zero instances of `@ts-ignore` or `eslint-disable` in upload components.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None in Milestone 3 deliverables.
- **Untested angles**: Live physical backend OCR GPU processing (out of scope for frontend audit, resilient fallbacks verified).
