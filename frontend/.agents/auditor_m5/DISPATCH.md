Mission:
Perform a Forensic Integrity Audit on the complete ClaimGuard AI frontend project:
1. Inspect the source code across `src/` (components, pages, services, types):
   - Check for hardcoded test results, fake facades, dummy mock shortcuts, or bypassed logic.
   - Verify that visualizations (ELA circular gauge, donut charts, waterfall bar, CGHS tariff comparison) compute math dynamically from input datasets rather than rendering hardcoded graphics.
   - Verify that data normalizers (`src/services/apiNormalizer.js`) perform genuine validation, type coercion, and defensive defaulting.
   - Verify that the cryptographic hash chain in `AuditTimeline.jsx` performs genuine SHA-256 validation.
   - Verify zero cheating and complete authentic implementation across all milestones.
2. Check that the build is genuine and contains real compiled code.
3. Write a thorough forensic integrity report to `c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\auditor_m5\handoff.md` with a definitive verdict: `CLEAN` or `INTEGRITY VIOLATION`.
4. Send a message to parent (`f7266c02-c6a6-4b2c-9f23-75f1cca7c70f`) when complete.
