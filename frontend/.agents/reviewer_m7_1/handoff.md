## 1. Observation

1. **Independent Verification Execution**:
   - `npm test`: Passed **72/72** tests across 4 tiers in 0.70s:
     - Tier 1: Feature Coverage & Contracts (30/30 Passed)

     - Tier 3: Combinations & Cross-Module (9/9 Passed)
     - Tier 4: Real-World Scenarios (5/5 Passed)
   - `node tests/check-imports.mjs`: Verified `framer-motion`, `sonner`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` present in `node_modules` and declared in `package.json`. Checked all import specs across 31 files in `src/` — all resolved cleanly.
   - `node tests/check-circular-deps.mjs`: Scanned 30 modules in `src/` — exactly **0** circular dependencies found.
   - `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`:
     - 41/41 SSR component stress tests passed.
     - Challenger M2 charts stress passed.
     - Challenger M2 table stress passed.
     - Challenger M3 upload stress (56/56 scenarios) passed in 5.34s.
   - `npm run build`: Vite v6.4.3 production build succeeded with exit code 0 in 19.38s (transformed 2069 modules, generated `dist/assets/index-oTxPIKhm.js` 705.46 kB, gzip: 206.44 kB).

2. **Codebase Scan Observations**:
   - `grep_search "react-hot-toast" src/`: Exactly **0** matches found across the entire codebase.
   - `grep_search "animate-spin" src/`: Exactly **0** matches found across the entire codebase.
   - `grep_search "from 'sonner'" src/`: Found in all 10 target consumer files (`Analysis.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`, `Upload.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `BatchDropzone.jsx`, `AppealLetter.jsx`, `DashboardCharts.jsx`, `AuditTimeline.jsx`, `ClaimsTable.jsx`, `VerdictCard.jsx`). All import named `{ toast }` from `'sonner'` (0 default imports).

3. **Motion Architecture (`src/components/common/PageMotion.jsx` & `src/App.jsx`)**:
   - `src/components/common/PageMotion.jsx` lines 18-39: Implements `pageVariants` with `initial: { opacity: 0, y: 8 }`, `animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.22, ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] } }`, `exit: { opacity: 0, y: -6, transition: { duration: 0.18, ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] } }`, fully compliant with `PROJECT.md` contract line 46-48.
   - `src/App.jsx` lines 144-169: Routes wrapped inside `<AnimatePresence mode="wait"><Routes location={location} key={location.pathname}>` with each route rendering inside `<PageMotion>`.
   - `src/App.jsx` lines 100-124: Mobile navigation drawer wrapped in `<AnimatePresence>` with backdrop fade (`motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }} exit={{ opacity: 0 }}`) and sliding drawer panel (`motion.aside initial={{ x: '-100%' }} animate={{ x: 0 }} exit={{ x: '-100%' }} transition={{ type: 'spring', damping: 28, stiffness: 300 }}`).
   - `src/App.jsx` lines 173-186: Sonner `<Toaster position="top-right" expand={true} richColors closeButton visibleToasts={6} theme="dark" toastOptions={{ className: 'font-sans text-xs', style: { borderRadius: '12px' } }} />`.

4. **KPI Cards & Motion Sparklines (`src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx`)**:
   - Lines 16-25 & 28-35: Container stagger variants (`staggerChildren: 0.08, delayChildren: 0.05`) and spring card entrance variants (`type: 'spring', stiffness: 260, damping: 24, y: 14 -> 0`).
   - Lines 164, 179, 197, 212: Micro-interactions `hover:scale-101 active:scale-[0.98] transition-transform` applied to each card container.
   - Lines 41-136: Defines and exports `MotionSparklineCurve({ data, color, width, height, className })` utilizing SVG cubic Bézier curves, area gradients, and stroke drawing animation (`motion.path pathLength: 0 -> 1` over 0.85s) with spring terminus highlight dot.
   - Lines 165-225: The 4 cards currently render `<MetricCard sparkline={...} />`. In `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx` line 234, `MetricCard` renders its internal static `<SparklineCurve />`.

5. **Loader Modernization**:
   - `src/components/common/StatusBadge.jsx`: Replaced spinning icon with dual-layer clinical pulsing beacon (`animate-ping bg-sky-400 opacity-75` + core `bg-sky-600`).
   - `src/components/upload/DocumentCard.jsx`: Replaced spinner with clinical beacon + shimmer pill (`skeleton-shimmer`).
   - `src/components/upload/ReadinessCheck.jsx`: Replaced spinning loader with clinical beacon + button shimmer wave, plus animated SVG checkmarks (`motion.path pathLength: 0 -> 1`).
   - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`: Replaced spinner with smooth CSS transform rotate transition (`rotate-180 duration-700 ease-in-out`).
   - `src/pages/Analysis.jsx`: Replaced 96px full-page spinner with high-fidelity `AuditorScannerHUD` (sonar ping wave, concentric radar boundary, dashed reticle, precision crosshairs, and pulsing sensor core).
   - `src/components/analysis/AuditTimeline.jsx`: Replaced spinning ShieldCheck with cryptographic verification beacon (`animate-ping bg-emerald-300` + core `bg-emerald-100`) and laser sweep beam.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Integrity & Compliance Analysis**:
   - Scanned implementation files for hardcoded test shortcuts, facade implementations, or mocked assertions. All mathematical routines (Bézier interpolation, currency formatting, stage transitions) are genuine implementations.
   - Verified that `worker_m7_motion` adhered strictly to their authorized file boundaries. The decision not to edit unowned `MetricCard.jsx` directly, but instead define and export `MotionSparklineCurve` in `ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx` for Milestone 8 integration, is consistent with team ownership constraints.
   - All 72 unit tests, 41 SSR stress tests, and 56 challenger scenarios pass against genuine component rendering.

2. **Quality & Functional Verification**:
   - Page transitions use `mode="wait"` in `AnimatePresence`. Keying on `location.pathname` guarantees that navigation across distinct routes smoothly animates out before mounting the incoming view, while changes to query parameters (such as `?tab=forensics` or `?inspect=CLM-XXXXX`) do not cause full route unmounts or layout flashes.
   - Sonner migration is complete and resilient: All call sites use named imports, eliminating the `TypeError: toast.success is not a function` bug associated with default imports in certain bundler environments. Stacked toasts with IDs in `Upload.jsx` provide continuous visual feedback through the 4-stage ingestion pipeline.
   - All legacy CSS `animate-spin` instances are eliminated and replaced with clinical indicators and skeleton shimmers, fulfilling the user's R1/R3 requirements.

## 3. Adversarial Challenges & Findings

### [Minor / Optimization] Finding 1: Mobile Drawer Exit Animation DOM Lifecycle
- **What**: In `src/App.jsx` line 102, the immediate child of `<AnimatePresence>` is a non-motion `<div>`:
  `<div className="md:hidden fixed inset-0 z-50 flex">`.
- **Where**: `src/App.jsx:102`
- **Why**: In Framer Motion, when a non-motion element without a `key` is the direct child of `<AnimatePresence>`, the container element can be unmounted immediately when `mobileMenuOpen` becomes `false`, truncating the exit animation of nested `<motion.aside>` and `<motion.div>` elements.
- **Suggestion for M8**: Promote the outer container to `<motion.div key="mobile-nav-drawer" className="md:hidden fixed inset-0 z-50 flex">` or move the backdrop and sidebar as direct keyed sibling children of `<AnimatePresence>`.

### [Minor / M8 Backlog] Finding 2: `MotionSparklineCurve` Integration in `MetricCard`
- **What**: `MotionSparklineCurve` is fully implemented and exported in `ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx`, but `MetricCard.jsx` currently renders its internal static `<SparklineCurve>`.
- **Where**: `src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx:41` & `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx:234`
- **Why**: Worker respected file ownership discipline and avoided modifying unowned `MetricCard.jsx`. As a result, the KPI cards stagger and scale on hover, but the sparkline path does not draw dynamically yet.
- **Suggestion for M8**: In Milestone 8 (Dashboard Bento Grid layout), either allow `MetricCard` to accept a custom `SparklineComponent` prop or update `MetricCard` to render `MotionSparklineCurve`.

### [Informational] Finding 3: `prefers-reduced-motion` Consideration
- **What**: Route transitions and sparklines execute without checking system accessibility preference `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Where**: `src/components/common/PageMotion.jsx:18`
- **Why**: The motion is very subtle (8px / 6px displacement, 0.22s duration) and does not trigger vestibular distress, but checking `useReducedMotion()` from `framer-motion` would provide complete enterprise accessibility conformance.
- **Suggestion for M9**: Add `useReducedMotion()` to optionally bypass translation offsets for users with motion sensitivity.
