- Status: Adversarial stress testing completed. Writing comprehensive handoff report.

## Completed Steps
- Read mandatory inputs: ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md, PROJECT.md, worker_m2_dashboard/handoff.md, DashboardCharts.jsx, MetricCard.jsx.
- Built test harness `tests/challenger-m2-charts-harness.jsx` and `tests/challenger-m2-charts-stress.mjs`.
- Added 8 Challenger M2 stress test suites to `tests/component-harness.jsx` and 5 mathematical boundary tests to `tests/tier2-boundary-cases.test.mjs`.
- Executed `npm test` (72 tests passing, 0 failing).
- Executed `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs` (41 component stress tests passing, 0 failing).
- Executed `npm run build` (production Vite build compiled cleanly in 5.03s).
- Empirically discovered and verified:
  1. FinancialWaterfallChart divide-by-zero (`height: NaNpx; marginBottom: NaNpx;`) when stats.total_recovered_amount = 0.
  2. StatusDonutChart 100% single category 2.5px gap artifact due to checking schema length rather than active non-zero slices.
  3. RuleViolationBarChart divide-by-zero (`width: NaN%`) when all rules have 0 count and 0 impact.
  4. formatCompactInr negative value formatting omission (`₹-50000`).
  5. SparklineCurve lack of per-element array sanitization propagating `NaN` into SVG spline path.
  6. Cross-filtering callback missing `typeof === 'function'` check.

## Next Steps
- Write comprehensive handoff.md report with verdict REJECT and exact remediations.
- Send notification message to parent agent.
