# BRIEFING — 2026-09-18T00:10:25Z

## Mission
Adversarially stress test SVG math, chart geometry, and visualization resilience in `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.jsx` and `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx`.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: challenger
- Roles: critic, specialist
- Working directory: c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\challenger_m2_2
- Original parent: bc58ea62-e6ba-49c9-a011-2939171e657b
- Milestone: M2
- Instance: 2 of 2

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code.
- Find bugs by writing and executing tests — generators, oracles, and stress harnesses.
- Must run verification code ourselves.
- Explicit verdict required: CONFIRM_CORRECTNESS or REJECT.

## Review Scope
- **Files reviewed**: `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.jsx`, `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx`
- **Context files**: `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`, `orchestrator_2/PROJECT.md`, `worker_m2_dashboard/handoff.md`
- **Verification harnesses**: `tests/challenger-m2-charts-harness.jsx`, `tests/challenger-m2-charts-stress.mjs`, `tests/component-harness.jsx`, `tests/tier2-boundary-cases.test.mjs`

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  1. Donut chart total=0 causes 0/0 NaN in strokeDasharray or divide-by-zero crashes. [TESTED: SAFE, 0/0 guarded by total>0 check and count===0 suppression]
  2. 100% single category donut causes circle rendering gap/seam artifact. [TESTED: VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED — 2.5px gap subtracted due to schema length check]
  3. Waterfall chart with 0 billed, negative recoverable, disallowed > billed causes broken coordinates/negatives/NaNs. [TESTED: CRITICAL VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED — maxVal=0 causes height: NaNpx and marginBottom: NaNpx]
  4. Sparkline curve generator in MetricCard with [], [42], [10, 10, 10], negatives, null/undefined inputs causes division by zero, invalid d path, or crashes. [TESTED: LARGELY SAFE, zero-range guarded by `|| 1`; corrupted array with undefined propagates NaN into path]
  5. Cross-filtering callbacks when onSelectStatusFilter is undefined or null throws TypeError. [TESTED: SAFE for undefined/null; missing typeof === 'function' check throws on truthy non-functions]
  6. RuleViolationBarChart when all rules have 0 count and 0 impact produces width: NaN%. [TESTED: VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED]
- **Vulnerabilities found**:
  1. `FinancialWaterfallChart`: `maxVal = 0` when `total_recovered_amount = 0`, producing `height: NaNpx; marginBottom: NaNpx;` (HIGH).
  2. `StatusDonutChart`: 100% single-category ring has an unclosed 2.5px gap artifact due to `dynamicBreakdown.length > 1` check (MEDIUM).
  3. `RuleViolationBarChart`: `maxVal = 0` when rules have 0 count/impact produces `width: NaN%` (MEDIUM).
  4. `formatCompactInr`: Negative amounts format as `₹-50000` instead of `-₹50K` (LOW).
  5. `SparklineCurve`: Corrupted array e.g. `[10, undefined, 30]` propagates `NaN` into SVG `d` attribute (LOW).
  6. `onSelectStatusFilter`: Missing `typeof === 'function'` check allows truthy non-functions to throw (LOW).
- **Untested angles**: None within M2 charts scope.

## Loaded Skills
- None

## Key Decisions Made
- Conclude with verdict **REJECT** due to the cold-start divide-by-zero `NaNpx` defect in `FinancialWaterfallChart` and the 100% single-category donut gap artifact.
- Provide concrete, non-breaking drop-in remediation code patches for the worker to easily resolve all 6 findings.
