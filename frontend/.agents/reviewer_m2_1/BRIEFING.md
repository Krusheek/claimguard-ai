# BRIEFING — 2026-09-17T18:46:00Z

## Mission
Objectively and adversarially review Milestone 2: Enterprise Dashboard & Visualizations.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: teamwork_preview_reviewer
- Roles: reviewer, critic
- Working directory: c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\reviewer_m2_1
- Original parent: bc58ea62-e6ba-49c9-a011-2939171e657b
- Milestone: Milestone 2: Enterprise Dashboard & Visualizations
- Instance: 1 of 1

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Review-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Check for integrity violations (hardcoded test outputs, dummy implementations, shortcuts)
- Evidence-based findings with exact file paths and line numbers
- Write handoff.md following 5-component report format
- Explicit verdict: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES
- Send final report via send_message to parent

## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.jsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard/ClaimsTable.jsx`
  - `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx`
- **Interface contracts**: `c:\Users\krusheek\Desktop\SIH\claimguard-ai\frontend\.agents\orchestrator_2\PROJECT.md`
- **Review criteria**: correctness, style, conformance, high-density clinical layout, skeletons/error states, production build, tests, accessibility

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (layout orchestration, skeleton states, error boundary, status cross-filtering)
  - `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.jsx` (Donut, Waterfall, Bar chart SVG implementations)
  - `src/components/dashboard/ClaimsTable.jsx` (search, sort, filter tabs, document pills, pagination, CSV)
  - `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx` (Bezier spline curve, variance pills, backwards compatibility)
  - `src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx` (4-card grid, INR formatting, benchmarks)
  - `npm test` & `tests/runner.mjs` (67/67 tests passed)
  - `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs` (33/33 component SSR tests passed)
  - `npm run build` (production build compiled in 4.46s, 0 errors)
  - `node tests/check-imports.mjs` & `node tests/check-circular-deps.mjs` (0 errors, 0 cycles)
- **Verdict**: APPROVE (with documented findings for M5 hardening)
- **Unverified claims**: None. All worker claims independently verified.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Empty/sparse waterfall steps array handling -> Found potential TypeError crash in footer summary.
  - Live stats dynamic calibration in FinancialWaterfallChart -> Found dead code path due to default prop passing.
  - Status classification consistency between Donut and Table -> Found semantic differences in FLAGGED & DISALLOWED.
  - Full-text search with null/undefined array elements -> Found missing null guard in filter callback.
  - SVG linearGradient ID collision across multiple cards -> Confirmed duplicate IDs generated.
  - Disallowance rate dynamism -> Found hardcoded static string.
  - Unused imports -> Found unused `FileSearch` in ClaimsTable.jsx.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: 2 Major findings, 1 Medium finding, 4 Minor findings (none constituting integrity violations or build breakers).
- **Untested angles**: Real-time WebSocket subscriptions (out of scope for M2).

## Key Decisions Made
- Confirmed zero integrity violations: genuine SVG math, real table filtering/sorting, clean production build.
- Issued APPROVE verdict to allow pipeline progression to M3 (Upload Studio), logging refinement items for M5 hardening.

## Artifact Index
- `handoff.md` — Comprehensive 5-component review report, findings, challenge report, and verdict
- `progress.md` — Liveness heartbeat and progress log
- `DISPATCH.md` — Original prompt and dispatch log
