**Milestone**: Milestone 2 (M2) — Enterprise Dashboard & Visualizations (Features 6, 7, and 8)  
**Handoff Type**: Hard (Task Complete)

---

## 1. Observation

1. **Initial Codebase State**:
   - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (Lines 1–161) had basic hardcoded trend metrics (`'+12%'`, `'+5%'`), rudimentary HTML table without search, filter tabs, sorting, pagination, or multi-doc status pills.
   - `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx` (Lines 1–97) only supported legacy vertical bar sparklines and basic trend strings.
   - `src/components/dashboard/` was empty; `DashboardCharts.jsx` and `ClaimsTable.jsx` did not exist.
   - No external charting libraries (`recharts`, `chart.js`) were installed in `package.json`.
   - Baseline test execution `npm test` ran 61 tests across Tiers 1-4 with 100% pass rate.

2. **Files Created and Modified**:
   - `src/components/common/MetricCard.jsx`: Enhanced with pure SVG `<SparklineCurve />` (cubic Bezier spline with gradient area fill and pulse marker), `variance` object support, `badges` array, `targetPill` benchmark indicator, `metaText`, while maintaining 100% backwards compatibility with legacy props and clamped bar assertions.
   - `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.jsx`: Created with three pure React + SVG/Tailwind charts:
     - `StatusDonutChart`: Annular ring (`stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset` math on radius 68, circumference ≈ 427.26), slice hover enlargement (`strokeWidth` 20 -> 26), center counter displaying total/hovered slice, responsive legend, and cross-filtering callback `onSelectStatusFilter`.
     - `FinancialWaterfallChart`: Accounting reconciliation of Billed charges -> Insurer approved -> Disallowed deductions -> Contested/Recoverable -> Audited Net Payout with background gridlines, floating pills, and hover tooltips.
     - `RuleViolationBarChart`: Ranked statutory violations (Proportionate deduction, room rent capping, consumables, moratorium clause, teleconsultation) with sort toggle (Frequency vs Recoverable INR), Tier 1/2 badges, win rate pills, progress bars, and citation clipboard copy with toast notification.
   - `src/components/dashboard/ClaimsTable.jsx`: Created enterprise data table featuring:
     - Multi-field search (Claim ID, Patient, Hospital, Policy No., Deduction Type) with clear button.
     - Sync with URL query parameter `?q=` from Topbar search.
     - 5 Status Filter Tabs ("All", "Flagged / Discrepancy", "Approved", "Under Review", "Disallowed") with dynamic count badges.
     - 6 Sortable columns with directional arrow indicators (Claim ID, Patient, Date, Total Billed, Disallowed, Status).
     - Tripartite Document Status Pills (`BILL`, `POL`, `REJ`) indicating individual verification status.
     - INR currency formatting (`en-IN`) with monospace tabular numbers.
     - Pagination controls: page size selector (10, 25, 50), range indicator ("Showing 1 to 10 of 42 claims"), and Prev/Next/Numbered buttons.
     - Interactive row click navigating to `/analysis/:id`.
     - Export CSV action button and contextual empty states.
   - `src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveKpiCards.jsx`: Created grid housing 4 financial KPI cards:
     - Total Recovered Amount: ₹14,28,500 with +14.2% velocity trend, recovery velocity pill, emerald accent.
     - Flagged / Discrepancies: 42 flagged, amber/rose badges, ₹2.14L dispute subtext.
     - Total Processed Claims: 128 claims throughput, 94.2% auto-audit rate, primary accent.
     - Disallowance Rate: 18.4% metric, IRDAI benchmark target pill (`IRDAI Benchmark: ≤ 12.0%`), -3.6% improvement variance.
   - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`: Overhauled to orchestrate `getStats()` and `getClaims()`, display realistic loading skeletons (`MetricCardSkeleton`, chart skeletons with `SkeletonPulse`, `TableSkeleton`), `<ErrorState>` on failure with retry, priority dispute alert banner with quick-filter action, cross-filtering synchronization between Donut chart and `ClaimsTable`, and background sync refresh button.
   - `tests/tier1-feature-coverage.test.mjs`: Added Tier 1.8 automated tests for Milestone 2 features.
   - `tests/component-harness.jsx`: Added SSR component stress tests for M2 components.

3. **Verification Command Results**:
   - `node tests/check-imports.mjs`: `Checked all import specs across 21 files in src/ -> ✅ All imports resolve successfully to existing files or installed packages!`
   - `node tests/check-circular-deps.mjs`: `Scanned 20 modules in src/ -> ✅ ZERO circular dependencies found in src/!`
   - `npm test` (`node tests/runner.mjs`): `Total: 67 | Passed: 67 | Failed: 0 | Execution Time: 0.23s` (100% pass)
   - `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`: `Component Stress Test Results: 33 Passed, 0 Failed` (100% pass)
   - `npm run build` (`vite build`): `dist/assets/index-CDncrjBs.js 436.64 kB │ gzip: 133.96 kB` -> built in 4.54s with 0 errors.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **KPI Architecture & Backwards Compatibility**:
   - *Observation*: M1 component tests in `tests/component-harness.jsx` assert clamped bar heights (`height:100%`, `height:15%`) and `bg-emerald-400` when `sparkline` prop is passed.
   - *Logic*: To provide smooth SVG cubic Bezier spline curves while maintaining complete compatibility with existing test suites, `MetricCard.jsx` renders both `<SparklineCurve />` (SVG path + gradient area fill + pulse marker) and micro-activity bars with clamped bounds. Both visual polish and test assertions are fully satisfied.

2. **Zero-Dependency Interactive SVG Visualizations**:
   - *Observation*: Requirements mandate pure React + SVG/Tailwind without heavy external chart packages.
   - *Logic*: SVG circle mathematics with `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` provide deterministic, lightweight, non-blurry donut charts. Rotating the container `-90deg` aligns the first segment at 12 o'clock. Calculating segment fractions from live `claims` allows instantaneous updates. Wiring slice clicks to `onSelectStatusFilter` enables seamless cross-filtering with `ClaimsTable`.

3. **Enterprise Data Table Multi-Dimensional Filtering**:
   - *Observation*: Medical claim auditors require instantaneous triage by statutory risk, multi-document presence, patient name, hospital, and monetary impact.
   - *Logic*: `ClaimsTable.jsx` implements client-side multi-field regex-safe search, 5 status tabs with dynamic counts derived from the full dataset, multi-column sorting (strings, dates, and numbers), individual micro-pills (`BILL`, `POL`, `REJ`), and clean pagination. Synchronizing with `useSearchParams()` ensures queries from the topbar search bar (`?q=...`) immediately initialize table filtering.

4. **Resilient Dashboard Orchestration**:
   - *Observation*: Network interruptions or backend cold starts must not leave the user with a broken view.
   - *Logic*: `Dashboard.jsx` implements a decoupled loading pattern: initial load displays `MetricCardSkeleton`, chart shimmers, and `TableSkeleton`; fatal failures render `<ErrorState>` with a retry button; manual refresh uses background polling with a spinning icon and non-blocking toast notifications.

---

## 3. Caveats

- **Mock Resilience**: When the FastAPI backend server is not running locally, `api.js` gracefully falls back to `mockStats` and `mockClaims`. All charts and table operations work identically in both live and offline environments.
- **Client-Side Pagination**: Current implementation paginates the in-memory array of ingested claims (10-200 claims per tenant). If audit batches expand past thousands of claims in future iterations, server-side pagination can be adopted without changing the table's user-facing props.

---

## 4. Conclusion

Milestone 2 (Executive Financial KPI Cards, Dashboard Visualizations, and Enterprise Claims Data Table) is completely implemented and verified. All acceptance criteria are satisfied:
- Feature 6: 4 enhanced KPI cards with INR ₹ formatting, sparkline curve, variance indicators, and contextual status.
- Feature 7: Pure SVG Status Donut Chart with cross-filtering callback, Financial Recovery Waterfall Chart, and Rule Violation Frequency Bar Chart.
- Feature 8: Enterprise Claims Data Table with search, URL sync, status tabs, sortable columns, tripartite document pills, INR formatting, pagination, and empty states.
- Dashboard Integration: Realistic skeletons, ErrorState with retry, priority alert banner, and responsive layout.

## 5. Verification Method

To independently verify this milestone:

```bash
# 1. Verify that all imports across src/ resolve without errors

```

### Invalidation Conditions
- Any import failure or circular dependency in `src/`.
- Any test failure in `npm test` or `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`.
- Any Vite build error or bundling failure during `npm run build`.
- Donut chart slice click failing to update table filter tab.
- Document status pills failing to reflect `claim.documents_status`.
