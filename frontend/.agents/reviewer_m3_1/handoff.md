**Overall Risk Assessment**: **LOW**

---

## 1. Observation

### 1.1 Source Code Inspection
1. **`src/pages/Upload.jsx`** (362 lines):
   - Overhauled into an enterprise clinical workspace with a 12-column responsive layout (7 cols left for Dropzone & Document Cards stack, 5 cols right for sticky Pre-Analysis Health Check).
   - Manages comprehensive upload state: `claimId`, `mode` (`'batch'` | `'guided'`), `isUploading`, `isAnalyzing`, `extractionStage` (0-3), `extractionProgress` (0-100%), and tripartite `documents` store (`HOSPITAL_BILL`, `INSURANCE_POLICY`, `REJECTION_LETTER`).
   - Implements `handleBatchFiles` (lines 104–144): Executes 4-step intake (regex auto-tagging, empty slot fallback filling, leftover overwrite, and sequential upload pipeline for seamless claim session ID chaining).
   - Implements interactive card mutation handlers: `handleReplace` (lines 158–162), `handleRemove` (lines 167–171), and `handleRetag` (lines 176–189, bidirectional slot swapping).
   - Implements `handleLoadSample` (lines 195–199) and `handleClearAll` (lines 204–215).
   - Implements `handleRunAudit` (lines 220–268): Sequential 4-stage timer animation (`Uploading & Hashing` -> `Extracting OCR Tokens` -> `Verifying Clinical Schema` -> `Ready for Forensics`) with interval cleanup on unmount/completion and navigation to `/analysis/${activeId}`.

2. **`src/components/upload/BatchDropzone.jsx`** (396 lines):
   - Implements Mode A (Batch Multi-Drop via `react-dropzone` `useDropzone`, max 3 files) and Mode B (Guided 3-Step with slotted drop targets and file browse inputs).
   - Exports `MAX_FILE_SIZE = 25 * 1024 * 1024` (26,214,400 bytes, line 17), `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` (`application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/tiff`, lines 19–24), and `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` (`.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, line 26).
   - Implements `validateUploadFile` (lines 32–62): Enforces non-empty check (`size > 0`), 25MB boundary ceiling, and MIME/extension whitelist.
   - Implements `autoTagDocument` (lines 68–88): Three-tier regex heuristics matching hospital bills, insurance policies, and rejection/settlement letters.
   - Provides visual drop feedback: `isBatchDragReject` highlights in crimson (`ring-4 ring-rose-500/25 border-rose-500 bg-rose-50/70`), `isBatchDragActive` highlights in brand blue ring with bouncing arrow, and resting state displays feature discovery pills.

3. **`src/components/upload/DocumentCard.jsx`** (269 lines):
   - Renders dual states: unattached empty slot (dashed border, `Pending Intake` pill, `Attach File` trigger) and attached document inspection card.
   - Formats file information: `getFormatChip` (PDF in rose, PNG/JPG in indigo, TIFF in emerald), `formatFileSize` (readable bytes/KB/MB), and status badge (`Verified` in emerald, animated `Extracting...` in sky, or `Upload Error` in rose).
   - Renders extracted clinical preview tags when `docRecord.metadata` exists (`line_items_count`, `sum_insured` in Lakhs, `disallowed_amount` with INR formatting, and `hospital_name`).
   - Implements auditor action controls: slot reclassification `<select>` dropdown (`onRetag`), file replacement file picker trigger (`onReplace`), and deletion button (`onRemove`).

4. **`src/components/upload/ReadinessCheck.jsx`** (432 lines):
   - Exports benchmark claim dataset `SAMPLE_APOLLO_CLAIM` (`CLM-84920`, Ayush Sharma, ₹1,24,000 billed, ₹42,500 disallowed, 24 itemized line items, ₹10 Lakh sum insured, 64-month continuous coverage, deduction voucher reasons).
   - Exports 4-stage extraction pipeline definition `EXTRACTION_STAGES` (lines 90–115).
   - Renders dynamic readiness gauge (`{uploadedCount}/3 Docs Attached ({readinessPercentage}%)`) with a 3-segment color-coded progress bar.
   - Renders Tripartite Verification Matrix with `CheckCircle2` / `XCircle` status icons.
   - Renders Forensic Inspection Scope checklist across 4 capabilities: itemized tariffs, policy limits, TPA disallowances, and ELA pre-scan.
   - Renders 1-Click Apollo Hospital Benchmark Claim Loader with session reset button.
   - Renders active 4-stage extraction animation display (pinging pulse dot, gradient progress bar with CSS shimmer, subtitle, and 4-segment stage ticker).
   - Gated CTA button: Disabled with `Lock` icon when incomplete, illuminated in teal-to-sky gradient with `ShieldCheck` when ready, and spinning indicator during analysis execution.

## 2. Logic Chain

1. **Requirement R3 & Survey Feature 9 (Dual-Mode Upload Studio)**:
   - *Observation*: `BatchDropzone.jsx` provides both Mode A ("Batch Multi-Drop") and Mode B ("Guided 3-Step") via a pill toggle. In Mode A, users drop 1–3 files simultaneously; `autoTagDocument` uses regex heuristics to detect document types and fills unmatched slots sequentially. In Mode B, 3 discrete drop targets accommodate auditors processing paperwork one item at a time.
   - *Inference*: Meets both bulk and step-by-step intake requirements without locking the user into a rigid wizard.

2. **Requirement R3 & Survey Feature 10 (Document Metadata & Extraction Inspection)**:
   - *Observation*: `DocumentCard.jsx` visualizes the slot, file format chip, human-readable file size, and status badge. For populated documents, it displays extracted clinical metadata (line items, sum insured, disallowed amount, hospital name).
   - *Inference*: Provides immediate transparency into extracted data before committing to the full statutory audit.
   - *Observation*: Each card includes Replace (opens targeted file picker), Remove (clears slot), and Retag (swaps slot classification via dropdown).
   - *Inference*: Guarantees that auditor corrections are immediate, non-destructive, and do not reset the active claim session.

3. **Requirement R3 & Survey Feature 11 (Pre-Analysis Health Check & UX Transitions)**:
   - *Observation*: `ReadinessCheck.jsx` displays a dynamic 0–100% readiness gauge, tripartite verification indicators, forensic checklist items, and gates the audit CTA until all 3 documents are attached.
   - *Observation*: The 1-click Apollo Hospital loader (`SAMPLE_APOLLO_CLAIM`) immediately populates benchmark claim `CLM-84920` with 24 itemized line items, policy limits, and deduction vouchers, enabling 100% readiness and instant transition to the analysis hub.
   - *Observation*: The 4-stage extraction animator visualizes `Uploading & Hashing` -> `Extracting OCR Tokens` -> `Verifying Clinical Schema` -> `Ready for Forensics` with a shimmer progress bar before navigating to `/analysis/:id`.
   - *Inference*: Resolves the generic spinner issue and provides enterprise feedback matching medical audit software standards.

4. **Integrity & Boundary Verification**:
   - *Observation*: File size is bounded to 25MB (`26,214,400` bytes) in frontend validation, matching backend contracts. 0-byte and unsupported formats (EXE, ZIP, HTML) are rejected with descriptive toast errors.
   - *Observation*: No test rigging, dummy bypasses, or hardcoded mock-returns exist in the actual upload components. API methods in `src/services/api.js` use real multipart `FormData` posts with graceful local client fallback when the Python backend is offline.

## 3. Adversarial Findings & Stress-Test Challenges

### Finding 1 (Minor / Edge Case): `formatFileSize` Negative Input Handling
- **Location**: `src/components/upload/DocumentCard.jsx:47-54`
- **What**: `formatFileSize(bytes)` computes `i = Math.floor(Math.log(bytes) / Math.log(1024))`. If a negative number is passed (e.g. from corrupted file stats), `Math.log(negative)` returns `NaN`, yielding `"NaN undefined"`.
- **Why**: While legitimate browser `File.size` is always non-negative, defensive programming prevents potential display corruption on malformed synthetic records.
- **Mitigation Suggestion**: Guard with `if (typeof bytes !== 'number' || bytes <= 0 || isNaN(bytes)) return bytes === 0 ? '0 B' : '—';`.
- **Risk**: Low (no user-facing failure under real browser uploads).

### Finding 2 (Minor / UX Heuristic): Heuristic Keyword Overlap in `autoTagDocument`
- **Location**: `src/components/upload/BatchDropzone.jsx:78`
- **What**: The policy regex contains keyword `care` (`/(...|care|...)/i`). Files from the CARE Hospitals network (e.g. `care_hospital_bill.pdf`) match the policy pattern before reaching the bill pattern, assigning the document to `INSURANCE_POLICY`.
- **Mitigation Present**: Fully mitigated in UX — the auditor can immediately reclassify the slot using the Retag dropdown on the `DocumentCard`, which swaps the slots in one click.
- **Mitigation Suggestion**: In future polish, refine regex to `/\bcare\s*(health|insurance|plan|policy)\b/i`.
- **Risk**: Low.

### Finding 3 (Medium / Coverage Gap): M3 Component Test Registration in Test Harness
- **Location**: `tests/component-harness.jsx`
- **What**: The existing automated test runner (`npm test`) and stress test runner (`node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`) pass with 100% success for all 72 + 41 tests, but components from M3 were not formally appended to `tests/component-harness.jsx`.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure Milestone 5 (Comprehensive E2E Verification & Victory Hardening) adds dedicated SSR component tests for `BatchDropzone`, `DocumentCard`, and `ReadinessCheck` to maintain regression coverage.
- **Risk**: Low for current milestone; medium for long-term regression safety.

## 4. Integrity Violation Assessment

| Integrity Check Item | Result | Evidence |
|----------------------|--------|----------|
| Hardcoded test results in source code | **CLEAN** | Source code contains no test-specific bypasses or hardcoded evaluation return values. |
| Dummy or facade implementations | **CLEAN** | Real `react-dropzone` integration, native drag-and-drop listeners, real React state, real API service integration. |
| Shortcuts bypassing intended task | **CLEAN** | Both Batch Multi-Drop and Guided 3-Step modes are fully implemented with real validation and card controls. |
| Fabricated verification logs | **CLEAN** | Worker's reported test counts (72/72 tests, 41/41 stress scenarios, build in ~5s) were replicated verbatim in independent execution. |
| Self-certifying without verification | **CLEAN** | Independently executed `npm test`, `node tests/run-stress-tests.mjs`, and `npm run build`. |

## 6. Caveats

1. **Browser Interactive File Picker**: Verification was conducted via static analysis, code tracing, SSR rendering, test execution, and Vite production bundle compilation. Operating system file-dialog modals cannot be driven directly without full browser automation (e.g. Playwright/Puppeteer).
2. **Backend Live GPU OCR**: When the Python backend is offline, API calls fallback gracefully to simulated responses with valid IDs (`CLM-XXXXX`), allowing full UI verification without requiring a local GPU.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Milestone 3: Upload Studio & UX Polish successfully fulfills all functional, architectural, and design requirements outlined in `PROJECT.md` and `ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`:
- The Dual-Mode Upload Studio provides both high-speed multi-file batch dropping and guided step-by-step target intake.
- Document Cards offer clinical metadata inspection with interactive Retag, Replace, and Remove actions.
- The Pre-Analysis Health Check provides clear tripartite validation, a 1-click Apollo benchmark demo, and a 4-stage extraction progress animation.
- Production build and test suites pass with 100% success.
- No integrity violations or critical blockers exist.

**Final Verdict: APPROVE**
